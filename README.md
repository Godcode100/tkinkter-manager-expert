# tkinter-manager-expert
This is a simple python file that uses tkinter 
You ask it for a club's manager and it gives you the name.
If it doesnt know the manager it asks you to educate it and then gives you the manager name next time you ask it
All this is stored and read from a text that we create and that the program reads from.
the manager_data.txt file will take the form club/manager and must be in the same location as our program
